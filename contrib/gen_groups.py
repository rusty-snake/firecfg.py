# Where <places to firejail> is a comma separated list consisting of
# - applications: $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications
# - autostart: $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/autostart
# - dbus-service: $XDG_DATA_DIRS/dbus-1/services
# - symlink: $PATH
# You can also mark a places as explicitly unset by prefixing it with a '!'.

# Inside a location the groups are read alphabetically (numbers, upper, lower).
#
# By confection groups shipped by firecfg.py start with a uppercase letter (and this file with a 0).
# User customization should go in a file starting with a lowercase letter.
